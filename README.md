# Hi there

I am currently studying data engineering at Stellenbosch University. The repos I have piined are a few of the projects I have done on the side while studying. I am in the midst of moving some of my older projects from [Coen-Potgieter/Projects](https://github.com/Coen-Potgieter/Projects) to their own dedicated repos. Regardless, the pinned repos below are some of the projects I am quite proud of. Here is a link to my [CV](https://coen-potgieter.github.io/CV/) if you're after that.
